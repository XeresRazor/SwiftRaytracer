# Swift Raytracer
A simple, moderately optimized Monte-Carlo path tracer implemented in Swift.

(Note, while named Swift Raytracer, this is actually a path-tracing renderer and produces high quality global illumination renderings.)

# Todo:
This Renderer is in active development.
- Surface texturing
- Volume rendering.
- Scene description format.
- Command line interface.
- Better shaders.
- Emissive surfaces.
- Better threading (bucket rendering)
- General performance improvements.
- Support for building via SPM (may have to wait until C module support is ready)
- Linux support.
- More to come.
